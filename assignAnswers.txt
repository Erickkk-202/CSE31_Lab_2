Assignment 1:
1. What line caused the segmentation fault?
The fault is in line 18. The reason why it has a fault is because the "&" is missing in front of the input.

2. How do you fix the line so it works properly?
The way you fix the sagmation fault is by adding a "&" in front of input in line 18.

3. What is the bug here?
The bug was that sum needs to be passed as a pointer instead of a variable.

4. How do you fix it?
I fixed it by addressing sum as a pointer and passing its value as a pointer.

Assignment 2:

1. Run the program with the following input: “HELLO!” for str1 and “hello!” for str2. Is the output
expected?

no the code is not expected. The code returned "HELLO!hello!hello!" instead of "HELLO!hello!"

2. Do not stop the program, enter “HI!” for str1 and “hi!” for str2. Is the output expected? What is
the bug here? Try to fix the program so it will print the output correctly.

The output printed out old memory with the new output. The way I fixed the code is by by adding "s1[s1len + s2len]='\0';" Which tells S1 that it is the end of the array.

3. Do not stop the program, enter “Hello! How are you?” for str1 and “I am fine, thank
you!

The output is not expected. The output has the two strings crashed together. I think the reason it does this is because it has a space after Hello!
Since it has a space after hello! the program thinks thats the end of the string.
